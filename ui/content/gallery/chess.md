I wanted to focus on joinery for my first design project at the Vermont Woodworking School.
The frame of the table consists of four 3-way miter joints for the top and the legs.
The sides are frame and panel construction.

Staying consistent with the Asian inspired leg joints, 
each mortice and tenon includes a hand cut "bird beak".
The chess board is walnut and maple end grain.
It floats between the top panels with a tongue and groove joint to allow for wood movement.
