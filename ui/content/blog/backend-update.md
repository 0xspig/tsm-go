## Rewired the sketchbook
I originally made the sketchbook page using tags.
That was kind of hacky though. 
"Sketchbook" isn't really a tag and I don't want to clutter my actual tags with utility tags.
I changed it so that "Sketches" are in a subdirectory of blogs.
This way they still show up in the blog but they're still their own section.
The pages are now filtered using categories instead of tags.
I messed with the Previous/Next function a little bit as well.
Hopefully its not too clunky.
Some links may be broken but I think I got them all.
