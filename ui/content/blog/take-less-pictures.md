## Digital cameras have ruined photography

While out painting this winter, there were I couple times I decided to limit myself to only 10 photographs per trip.

Two things happened when I did that:
1. I usually took less than 10 pictures
2. They were all good

With no limits on what I can capture I try to get everything and end up with nothing.
In fact, what I have actually worse than nothing.
I have a big pile of noise.
It's going to take me at least an hour to sort through all 200+ pictures that I can't even remember why I took.
I always think to myself, "I don't have time now, but I could do a study of that later".
The reality is, **if I can't be bothered to study it from life then its not worth studying.**

Beirstadt didn't need a camera to git gud.
