## Introducing the "Sketchbook"

I've added a new section to the site!

A bunch of text links is pretty boring for a blog about painting.
Now there's a separate section called [Sketchbook](/blog/sketch) for image posts.
They're still part of the regular blog, but now they're over there too.
I'll probably add something similar to the gallery when I get the time to finish up the articles.

If you want to follow only my paintings (no random stuff like this), you can subscribe to the [sketchbooks RSS](/blog/sketch/index.xml).
