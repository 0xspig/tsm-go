It's officially spring in New England and that means green.
I recently did two plein air paintings, both of which I think are some of my best plein airs so far.
<div>
<img src="/static/images/blog/no-green/woodland-clearing.jpg" width="35%" class="image-float-left" style="padding-inline:1.5em;">
<img src="/static/images/blog/no-green/marsh.jpg" width="55%" "padding-inline:1.5em;">
</div>

But when I look at them on the wall they just dont pop.
There is something about green that no matter where you see it, your brain just wants to tune it out.
Next time I go out I'll try to keep my colors solidly within the blue or yellow camps.
