## View from my room
Quick sketch from my bedroom window. Trying to work on color.

Palette:

- Ultramarine Blue
- Lemon Yellow
- Yellow Ochre
- A *very* small amount of Cad. Red to grey down trees in the front.

I'm finding that the key to non-muddy colors is to actually use less color.
I've noticed that most good paintings have only one dominant color. 
This split complementary palette of *cool yellow*, *warm yellow*, *blue* seems to do a pretty good job at preventing me from mixing mud.
The tiny amount of Cad Red is a nice utility for muting certain colors without changing the value too much. 
I think if anything were to show as actually *red* though it would look real bad.
