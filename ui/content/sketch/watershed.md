This is a painting I did before I took {Mark Boedges' workshop}(/blog/mark-boedges-workshop.md).
I was really struggling with my {solvents}(/blog/solvents.md) at that point.
I don't like the way the surface turned out and it's a little dull on account of using too much OMS.
The drawing was spot on though.
Despite floundering with the medium I felt like I was in the Schmid-Zone the whole time.
