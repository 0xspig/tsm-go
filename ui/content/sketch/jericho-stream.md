Painted a little river in Jericho this afternoon.
This one was a wild ride.
I was going pretty steady getting in the main rock in when it started to sprinkle.
I wanted to at least get the water in so I had some ideas to work from when I got home.
I quickly washed it in and at that point I was actually really happy with the painting.

But then it stopped raining - great I can take my time now.
I spent the next hour overrendering, wiping out, and repainting the water.
As I spent all this time ruining my great block in, the light went from full overcast to spotty sunshine.

The result isn't the worst thing I've ever done but it feels a little silly knowing it looked better with about 2 hours less work.
